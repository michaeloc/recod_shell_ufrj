This repository presents LithoVision, an end-to-end solution for Carbonate Rock Classification in the Brazilian Pre-Salt. Our approach combines a pre-trained self-supervised Transformer (DinoV2) with an adapted Central Difference Convolutional DenseNet121, leveraging the strengths of both architectures.

The lithoVision.py file demonstrates the approach on a private dataset, while the provided Jupyter notebook applies the same method in a cross-validation setting using a public dataset, referred to as ODP. The ODP dataset is available at:
