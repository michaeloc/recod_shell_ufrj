This repository presents the LithoVision solution for Carbonate Rock Classification in the Brazilian Pre-Salt. 
An end-to-end solution based on a hybrid approach. Here, we combiene a pre-trained self-supervised Tranformer called DinoV2 and an adapted Central Difference Convolutional Densenet121.
The experiment presented in the *lithoVision.py* file shows the approach in two datasets, the first one is public dataset, and the second is private, but we can release by requests.

In order to execute the experiments, install the libraries in the *requirements.txt* file.
